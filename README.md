<summary>Tip1: Direct2D Effects in Delphi (After using our new unit bellow) ðŸŒŸ</summary>


 **Problem:**  
the Delphi built-in units D2D are missing lot of interfaces including "ID2D1Effect".

 **Overview:**  

This guide explains how to apply Direct2D effects in Delphi using a clean and reusable iD2DEffect interface. The provided API.D2D.Effects unit encapsulates Direct2D effects, allowing you to:

  Apply Gaussian blur, shadow, and other effects.
  Set input images for the effect.
  Chain method calls for cleaner code.
  Use multiple property types (Single, Integer, Boolean).
  Safely render effects without memory leaks.

 **Solution:**  
 you can use our under-dev unit in your own-risk!
 ----  
Creating and Applying Direct2D Effects

Step 1: Initialize the Effect
```pascal
uses
  ...
  API.D2D.Effects;

type
  TMainView = class(TForm)
  strict private
    fD2DCanvas: TDirect2DCanvas;
    fD2DEffect: iD2DEffect;
    function GetD2DEffect: iD2DEffect;
...
  public
    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;
    destructor Destroy; override;

    property D2DEffect: iD2DEffect read GetD2DEffect;
  end;

{ TMainView }

function TMainView.GetD2DEffect: iD2DEffect;
begin
  if not Assigned(fD2DEffect) then
    fD2DEffect := GetTDirect2DEffect(fD2DCanvas.RenderTarget, CLSID_D2D1GaussianBlur);

  Result := fD2DEffect;
end;
```
  
Step 2: Set Input and Configure Effect 
```pascal
      D2DEffect.SetInputBitmap(0, LD2DBitmap)

      .(0, D2D1_GAUSSIANBLUR_PROP_STANDARD_DEVIATION, 3.5)

      .(0, D2D1_GAUSSIANBLUR_PROP_OPTIMIZATION,
           D2D1_DIRECTIONALBLUR_OPTIMIZATION_SPEED)

      .(0, D2D1_GAUSSIANBLUR_PROP_BORDER_MODE,
           D2D1_BORDER_MODE_HARD);

          // Begin Direct2D drawing
      fD2DCanvas.BeginDraw;
      try
        // Draw blured image
        D2DEffect.DrawEffectImage;

        // Optionally, draw additional UI elements on top
        // fD2DCanvas.DrawRectangle(...);
      finally
        fD2DCanvas.EndDraw;
      end;
...etc
```
Step 3: Render the Effect  
```pascal
D2DEffect.DrawEffectImage;
```
Features & Benefits

âœ… Encapsulated Direct2D Effect Handling

Instead of manually managing effect creation, this unit provides a structured interface-based approach.

âœ… Method Chaining

Write cleaner and more readable effect configurations using method chaining.

âœ… Multiple Data Type Support

The ApplyEffect method supports different types:
```pascal
D2DEffect.ApplyEffect(aIndex, aPropType, 5.0);  // Single (Float)
D2DEffect.ApplyEffect(aIndex, aPropType, 1);    // Integer
D2DEffect.ApplyEffect(aIndex, aPropType, True); // Boolean
```
âœ… Automatic Memory Management

Using interfaces (iD2DEffect), the effect is automatically freed when no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.  
## Full Example:
```pascal
var
  LD2DEffect: iD2DEffect;
begin
  LD2DEffect := GetTDirect2DEffect(SomeRenderTarget, CLSID_D2D1GaussianBlur);
  
  LD2DEffect.SetInputBitmap(0, SomeD2DBitmap)
      .(0, D2D1_GAUSSIANBLUR_PROP_STANDARD_DEVIATION, 3.5)
      .(0, D2D1_GAUSSIANBLUR_PROP_OPTIMIZATION,
           D2D1_DIRECTIONALBLUR_OPTIMIZATION_SPEED)
      .(0, D2D1_GAUSSIANBLUR_PROP_BORDER_MODE,
           D2D1_BORDER_MODE_HARD);
end;
```
How It Works Internally

GetTDirect2DEffect: Creates a new effect instance.

SetInputBitmap: Assigns an input bitmap to the effect.

ApplyEffect: Sets effect properties dynamically.

DrawEffectImage: Draws the effect output onto the render target.

<summary>Tip1: Enhancing TDirect2DCanvas with Modern Windows Composition APIs ðŸŒŸ</summary>

## Executive Summary

This document proposes enhancing the `TDirect2DCanvas` class to leverage modern Windows composition APIs, including DirectComposition (Windows 8+), Windows.UI.Composition (Windows 10), and Microsoft.UI.Composition (Windows 10 1809+). This enhancement would significantly improve performance, enable modern UI capabilities, and provide a competitive advantage for Delphi applications on Windows platforms.

## Current Limitations

The current `TDirect2DCanvas` implementation has several limitations:

1. **Limited Hardware Acceleration**: While it uses Direct2D for rendering, it doesn't leverage hardware-accelerated composition, which is essential for smooth animations and modern UI effects.

2. **Transparency Issues**: The current implementation has limited support for true transparency and layering, which are crucial for modern UI design.

3. **Performance Gaps**: Without hardware-accelerated composition, applications may experience performance issues, especially with complex visual effects or animations.

4. **Missing Modern Features**: The current implementation doesn't support modern Windows UI features like blur effects, shadows, and advanced animations.

5. **FMX Integration**: FireMonkey (FMX) currently does not replicate these DirectComposition capabilities, creating a gap between VCL and FMX applications on Windows.

## Technical Implementation

The proposed enhancement would introduce a new class `TDirect2DCompositionCanvas` that extends `TDirect2DCanvas`:

```pascal
type
  TCompositionType = (ctNone, ctDirectComposition, ctWindowsUI, ctMicrosoftUI);
  
  TDirect2DCompositionCanvas = class(TDirect2DCanvas)
  private
    fCompositionType: TCompositionType;
    fDCompDevice: IDCompositionDevice3;
    fDCompTarget: IDCompositionTarget;
    fDCompVisual: IDCompositionVisual2;
    fDCompSurface: IDCompositionSurface;
    fLastWidth: Integer;
    fLastHeight: Integer;
  private
    function DetectCompositionType: TCompositionType;
    function InitDirectComposition: Boolean;
    procedure EnsureSurface;
    procedure UpdateVisualSize;
  protected
    procedure CreateHandle; override;
    procedure DestroyHandle; override;
    procedure Resize; override;
  public
    constructor Create; override;
    destructor Destroy; override;
    
    // Override drawing methods
    procedure BeginDraw; override;
    procedure EndDraw; override;
  end;
```

The `DetectCompositionType` function would determine the appropriate composition API based on the Windows version:

```pascal
function TDirect2DCompositionCanvas.DetectCompositionType: TCompositionType;
var
  LVersionInfo: TOSVersionInfoEx;
  LBuildNumber: Integer;
begin
  Result := ctNone;
  
  // Get OS version information
  ZeroMemory(@LVersionInfo, SizeOf(LVersionInfo));
  LVersionInfo.dwOSVersionInfoSize := SizeOf(LVersionInfo);
  
  if not GetVersionEx(LVersionInfo) then
    Exit;
    
  LBuildNumber := LVersionInfo.dwBuildNumber;
  
  // Windows 8 or later supports DirectComposition
  if (LVersionInfo.dwMajorVersion > 6) or 
     ((LVersionInfo.dwMajorVersion = 6) and (LVersionInfo.dwMinorVersion >= 2)) then
  begin
    Result := ctDirectComposition;
    
    // Windows 10 supports Windows.UI.Composition
    if (LVersionInfo.dwMajorVersion > 10) or 
       ((LVersionInfo.dwMajorVersion = 10) and (LVersionInfo.dwBuildNumber >= 10240)) then
    begin
      Result := ctWindowsUI;
      
      // Windows 10 1809+ supports Microsoft.UI.Composition
      if LBuildNumber >= 17763 then
        Result := ctMicrosoftUI;
    end;
  end;
end;
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Hardware-accelerated composition significantly reduces CPU usage and improves rendering performance, especially for animations and visual effects.

2. **Modern UI Capabilities**: The enhancement enables modern UI design patterns, including true transparency, blur effects, shadows, and advanced animations.

3. **Better Developer Experience**: Developers can create more visually appealing applications with less code, as the composition APIs handle many complex visual effects automatically.

4. **Competitive Advantage**: Delphi applications can match the visual quality of applications built with other modern frameworks, providing a competitive advantage in the market.

5. **FMX Integration Opportunity**: This enhancement could be extended to FMX, creating a consistent experience across both VCL and FMX applications on Windows.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Version Detection**: The implementation must reliably detect the Windows version and available composition APIs to ensure compatibility across different Windows versions.

2. **Resource Management**: Proper resource management is crucial to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient use of system resources.

3. **Surface Management**: The implementation must efficiently manage composition surfaces, minimizing surface recreation and optimizing rendering performance.

4. **Performance Optimization**: The implementation should batch composition operations and minimize unnecessary redraws to maximize performance.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: The enhancement should gracefully fall back to standard rendering when composition APIs are not available, ensuring compatibility with older Windows versions.

6. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: While this enhancement is Windows-specific, the API design should maintain compatibility with the cross-platform nature of Delphi applications.

## Timeline of Windows Composition APIs

1. **DirectComposition**: Introduced in Windows 8 (2012)
   - Provides hardware-accelerated composition
   - Enables smooth animations and transitions
   - Supports basic visual effects

2. **Windows.UI.Composition**: Introduced in Windows 10 (2015)
   - Builds on DirectComposition
   - Adds support for more advanced visual effects
   - Improves performance and capabilities

3. **Microsoft.UI.Composition**: Introduced in Windows 10 1809 (2018)
   - Latest iteration of composition APIs
   - Provides the most advanced visual effects
   - Offers the best performance and capabilities

## FMX Integration Opportunity

FireMonkey (FMX) currently does not replicate the DirectComposition integration capabilities. By extending FMX to incorporate these composition APIs, Embarcadero could significantly enhance the capabilities of FMX applications on Windows platforms while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

A potential FMX enhancement could follow a similar pattern to the VCL implementation, with platform-specific code that leverages the appropriate composition APIs based on the Windows version. This would allow developers to create more modern, visually appealing applications with minimal additional code, positioning FMX as a more competitive platform for developing modern Windows applications.

## Future Extensions

1. **WinUI 2 Support**: The enhancement could be extended to support WinUI 2, enabling even more advanced UI capabilities.

2. **WinUI 3 Support**: Future versions could add support for WinUI 3, providing access to the latest Windows UI features.

3. **XAML Islands**: The enhancement could be extended to support XAML Islands, allowing Delphi applications to embed modern Windows UI controls.

## Conclusion

Enhancing `TDirect2DCanvas` with support for modern composition APIs presents a golden opportunity to significantly improve the capabilities of Delphi applications on Windows platforms. This enhancement would provide better performance, enable modern UI capabilities, and offer a competitive advantage in the market.

By implementing this enhancement, Embarcadero can position Delphi as a modern, capable platform for developing Windows applications, attracting new developers and retaining existing ones. The enhancement would also create a foundation for future improvements, such as support for WinUI 2, WinUI 3, and XAML Islands.

Furthermore, extending this enhancement to FMX would create a consistent experience across both VCL and FMX applications on Windows, providing a unified development experience for Delphi developers.

The implementation would be transparent to developers, requiring no changes to existing code, and would gracefully fall back to standard rendering when composition APIs are not available, ensuring compatibility with older Windows versions.
